        <h2>History of HTML</h2>
        <p>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is a fundamental language used for creating and structuring web content. It has a rich history dating back to the early days of the World Wide Web. Here is a brief overview of the history of HTML:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The Birth of the Web (1989-1990):</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, is credited with inventing the World Wide Web. In 1989, he proposed the idea of a global hypertext project while working at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research).</li>
                <li>In 1990, he wrote the first web browser and web server software and developed the first version of HTML to create and share documents on the nascent web.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>HTML 1.0 (1993):</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The first official specification of HTML, HTML 1.0, was published in 1993 as an Internet Draft.</li>
                <li>HTML 1.0 provided basic elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and links, forming the foundation of web documents.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>HTML 2.0 (1995):</li>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML 2.0 was the first standardized version of HTML, introduced in 1995.</li>
                <li>It added support for tables, image embedding, and forms.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>HTML 3.2 (1997):</li>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML 3.2 was the next significant milestone, adding features like frames, client-side image maps, and improved support for tables and forms.</li>
                <li>It was widely adopted and helped shape the web during the mid-1990s.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>HTML 4.01 (1999):</li>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML 4.01, the fourth major revision of HTML, was released in 1999.</li>
                <li>It introduced CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling web pages, which separated content and presentation.</li>
                <li>HTML 4.01 had extensive support for multimedia, scripting, and accessibility features.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>XHTML (2000):</li>
            <ul>
                <li>XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) was introduced as the next step in the evolution of HTML in 2000.</li>
                <li>XHTML combined the rules of XML with HTML to create a stricter, more structured version of HTML.</li>
                <li>It aimed to make web pages more compatible with XML and improve web document structure.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>HTML5 (2008):</li>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML5, the fifth major version of HTML, was introduced in 2008.</li>
                <li>It brought significant enhancements, including native support for audio and video, canvas for drawing, and the introduction of semantic elements (e.g., &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;).</li>
                <li>HTML5 also improved web forms and introduced APIs for geolocation, local storage, and more.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>HTML Living Standard (ongoing):</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Unlike previous versions, HTML5 is considered a "living standard," which means it's continuously evolving rather than having a fixed specification.</li>
                <li>It continues to receive updates and improvements to keep up with the changing web landscape and technological advancements.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <p>HTML has remained a critical part of web development, and its ongoing development ensures that it adapts to the ever-changing needs of the internet and remains a foundation for creating web content.</p>
